Testing suggestions from orphans
The set of 'base' reactions results in 3 positive reactions. Bigger than 1.8 so no need to bisect
Testing suggestions from subsystems
The set of 'base' reactions has an accuracy of 0.6 which is bigger than the threshold of 0.5. No need to bisect
Testing suggestions from essential
If we combine all reactions, we have get 1 true positives
We can not get more than this, so we can't exceed 1.8
