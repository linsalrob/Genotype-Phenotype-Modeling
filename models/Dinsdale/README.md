# Models for the Genotype Phenotype project

These models are all built for the SDSU genotype phenotype project, and cover the genomes that we are sequencing. 

We have [predicted growth](growth_predictions.md) of 14 different strains on 97 different media (1,225 predictions in total) and we have used these to build models of the different genomes.
