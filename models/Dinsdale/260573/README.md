# Growth of ED144

ED144 grows on 50 different conditions (this seems excessive!)

## Essential Reactions

Five reactions were required by 24/24 models, and one reaction (rxn02374) was required by 13/24 models:

Reaction ID | Equation | Protein
--- | --- | ---
rxn10473 | (1) Cl-[e] <=> (1) Cl-[c] | Chloride channel protein
rxn05195 | (1) H2O[c] + (1) ATP[c] + (1) fe3[e] <=> (1) ADP[c] + (1) Phosphate[c] + (1) H+[c] + (1) fe3[c] | No roles for this reaction
rxn05116 | (1) H+[c] + (1) 2-Amino-3-oxo-4-phosphonooxybutyrate[c] <=> (1) CO2[c] + (1) 3-Amino-2-oxopropyl phosphate[c] | No roles for this reaction
rxn01208 | (1) CO2[c] + (1) 4MOP[c] <=> (1) H+[c] + (1) 2-isopropyl-3-oxosuccinate[c] | No roles for this reaction
rxn00392 | (1) ATP[c] + (1) Riboflavin[c] <=> (1) ADP[c] + (1) FMN[c] + (1) H+[c] | Riboflavin kinase (EC 2.7.1.26); FMN adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.2)

We add those reactions.

## Orphan reactions

One reaction was added to 20 models:

Reaction ID | Equation | Protein
--- | --- | ---
rxn31834 | (1) H2O[c] + (1) 5-Amino-6--5-phosphoribitylaminouracil[c] <=> (1) Phosphate[c] + (1) 4--1-D-Ribitylamino-5-aminouracil[c] | No roles for this reaction

## Subsystem reactions

One reaction (rxn01256) was added to 24 models, and one reaction (rxn00656) was added to 23 models.

Reaction ID | Equation | Protein
--- | --- | ---
rxn01256 | (1) Chorismate[c] <=> (1) Prephenate[c] | Periplasmic chorismate mutase I precursor (EC 5.4.99.5); Chorismate mutase (EC 5.4.99.5); Chorismate mutase III (EC 5.4.99.5); Chorismate mutase II (EC 5.4.99.5)

## Close reactions

255 close reactions were added. We add any close reaction that is in 10 or more models (somewhat randomly).

# Revised models

The revised model has 1,194 reactions.
